-- The returned value will be an array of string. Numeric portions of the
-- version are padded to 9 digits so they will compare numerically, but
-- without relying on how numbers compare relative to strings. Dots are dropped,
-- but dashes are retained. Trailing zeros between alpha segments or dashes
-- are suppressed, so that e.g. "2.4.0" is considered the same as "2.4".
-- Alphanumeric parts are lower-cased.
--
-- The algorithm assumes that strings like "-" and any alpha string that
-- alphabetically follows "final" represents a "patch level". So, "2.4-1"
-- is assumed to be a branch or patch of "2.4", and therefore "2.4.1" is
-- considered newer than "2.4-1", which in turn is newer than "2.4".  Also
-- 2.4p2 and 2.4-p2 are considered to be the same as 2.4-2.
--
-- Strings like "a", "b", "c", "alpha", "beta", "candidate" and so on
-- (that come before "final" alphabetically) are assumed to be pre-release
-- versions, so that the version "2.4" is considered newer than "2.4a1".
-- Any "-" characters preceding a pre-release indicator are removed.
--
-- Finally, to handle miscellaneous cases, the strings "pre", "preview",
-- and "rc" are treated as if they were "c", i.e. as though they were
-- release candidates, and therefore are not as new as a version string
-- that does not contain them. And the string "dev" is treated as if it
-- were an "@" sign; that is, a version coming before even "a" or "alpha".

-- @return canonical version string suitable for comparison
