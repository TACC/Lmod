This is a macOS privacy/permissions issue. The terminal doesn’t have permission to access your Downloads folder, even though you own it.

## Why This Happens

macOS restricts terminal access to certain directories (like Downloads, Desktop, Documents) unless the terminal app has Full Disk Access. This is separate from file permissions.

## How to Fix It

1. Open System Settings (or System Preferences on older macOS).
2. Go to Privacy & Security → Full Disk Access.
3. Click the + button.
4. Add your terminal app:
   - Terminal.app: `/Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app`
   - iTerm2: `/Applications/iTerm.app` (if installed)
   - Or whichever terminal you’re using
5. Toggle it ON in the list.
6. Restart your terminal.

After that, `ll ~/Downloads` should work.

## Alternative Workaround

If you don’t want to grant Full Disk Access, you can:
- Use Finder to navigate to Downloads
- Or use `open ~/Downloads` to open it in Finder

The Full Disk Access setting is the proper fix if you want terminal access to these directories.
