Lmod 8.7+
   (8.7.1)  * Updates on 5/3 presentation.
   (8.7.2)  * Print message when unloading an unknown module (but not in a purge or dependent module)
   (8.7.3)  * Report warning when an MODULEPATH directory has too many non-modulefiles
            * A .version or .modulerc that has non-zero file length and doesn't start
              with "#%Module" is ignored.
	    * Report an Infinite loop error if loading the same modulefile 500 times.
	    * Add note to 095_tcl2lua.tcl about the whole TCL modulefile being evaluated by TCL.
	      Note also that this is not a SOURCE-to-SOURCE translation from TCL to Lua.
	    * Cannot use local with KSH
	    * Only add to mpathMapT when mpath_old ~= mpath_new in l_processNewModulePath(path).
   (8.7.4)  * Issue #578: Dynamic Spider Cache supported. 
            * Change Regular files counter to ignore files that start with "." when counting non-modulefiles in
              src/DirTree.lua
   (8.7.5)  * Issue #583: Using userName instead of sn when refreshing.
            * Issue #580: Add check for valid env. names for family(), setenv() etc.

	      setenv and pushenv.
	    * Issue #587: Fix bug created with #580 namely that env vars can start with "_"

	      shell
   (8.7.7)  * Add option --miniConfig to report configuration differences from default.
            * Setting LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES to __NO_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES__ will allow
	      module reset to purge and reset $MODULEPATH to the system one.
	    * Make LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES a cosmic variable.
   (8.7.8)  * Add mcp:mustLoad() in cmdfuncs.lua: Unload(...).  Must catch case where
              reloading a replacement module depend on a module which is not there
              (See comments in test rt/depends_on/depends_on.tdesc about oneapi and impi)
            * Issue #593: In DirTree.lua l_versionFile(), Now only evaluate the highest priority
              entry in defaultA, instead of all.  This avoids the issue where there is a .modulerc.lua
              which works and a .modulerc or .version file which has syntax errors.
   (8.7.9)  * Correctly generate Version.lua file when installing from a tar ball.

            * Unsetting FPATH inside configure.ac to avoid bad interaction with possible
              K-shell support.
            * ml now understands "--" to mean stop processing options.
            * LMOD_FAST_TCL_INTERP is set to true by default.  Make fixes to rt/commmon_funcs.sh to turn
              it off for tests.  Except that the end2end test needs it true.
            * Move cache file location from ~/.lmod.d/.cache/* to ~/.cache/lmod/*
            * Set FPATH in bash.in so that it works correctly with both Zsh and Ksh.
            * Issue #594: change cp -p to cp and mv to mv -f in update_lmod_system_spider_cache.in.

   (8.7.13) * Transitional support for using ~/.config/lmod for collections. Currently collectionw are
              are written to both ~/.lmod.d/ and ~/.config/lmod.  Site can switch to writting only to
              ~/.config/lmod by configuring with --with-useDotConfigOnly=yes. Lmod will continue read
               from both directories to find a collection.

            * Rename Master        to Hub
            * Rename masterTbl     to optionTbl.  Note that the masterTbl() is equal to optionTbl()
              therefore SitePackage and /etc/lmod/lmod_config.lua files can continue to use masterTbl
	    * PR #600: merging in 600_category to support "module category"
            * Issue #604: Fixed bug where ref_count was not passed to swapped modules.
   (8.7.15) * Issue #613: setenv and pushenv change local environment when runniing spider (and avail)

	    * Added debugging stmts to track down issue when adding loop in MODULEPATH when doing a spider.
            * Zsh now gets /path/to/ksh_scripts if KSH_SUPPORT is yes.

            * Allow ksh93, mksh and pdksh report shellname (myShellName()) as ksh.
   (8.7.18) * Fix bug where repeating the same directory in the $MODULEPATH would cause a loopback
              and therefore a stack overflow when building the spider cache.

              passes portably.
