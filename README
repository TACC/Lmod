------------------------------------------------------------------------
This release of Lmod marks yet another internal refactoring of how it
works. The commands that your users see remains the same but the
internal on how it works has.   It is VERY VERY MUCH recommended that
you read the INSTALL file before trying to install this new version of
Lmod.  For the impatient, the major changes are:

   * This and future version of Lmod rely on the spider cache.  This
     speeds thing up and spider should now never crash w.r.t bad module
     files.
   * All module files are loaded through a "sandbox" which means that
     a module file can only call functions that are known to the sandbox.
     Those of you using the SitePackage.lua or similar will need to
     register your functions with the sandbox
   * Bad module files which can be: (1) bad syntax, (2) invalid
     arguments, (3) Calling functions that modulefiles shouldn't.  All
     of these mistakes should be caught and not kill building of the
     spider cache file.
   * A new hook function will make it easier for module use tracking 
     without having to have special functions inside of your module
     files.
   * Support for multilevel modulefile naming schemes.  Lmod now
     supports naming scheme such as  category/name/version. (C/N/V)
     It will actually supports category/sub_category/name/version or
     any depth that your users will tolerate that much typing.

I am changing my numbering scheme to have alpha, beta and release
candidates. This version is a beta.   You may wish to have staff use
this version before letting your users have at it.   Please note that
mixing a 4.* version with this version is safe,  mixing a 3.* version or
earlier and this one is not.  Bug reports showing problems between
Lmod 3.* and 5.* will receive a polite response to upgrade your 3.*
version to 4.2.1.

Note that if your site is using C/N/V style naming convention, that only
Lmod 5.+ supports this.  I have done as much testing as I can without
running a site that uses that style.  My tests show that the software
hierarchy works just fine with a C/N/V scheme.  I am interested in
hearing about sites that use a C/N/V scheme and any issues that come up.

Please consider joining the Lmod-users mailing list.

Please read the INSTALL file even if you have installed Lmod before
as the method of installing Lmod has changed.

------------------------------------------------------------
Version 5.0rc1
  Bug Fix:
    1) This version handles old cache files instead of crashing.
    2) Correctly handling of Personal module directories.
  Feature:
    1) Bash command line tab completion for both module and ml
       commands. 
    2) Support for multiple system cache files added, see
       contrib/BuildSystemCacheFile/README.txt for more details.
    3) New option "--terse" for list, avail and spider.  This
       produces machine readable output for these commands
    4) New option "--default" for avail.  This will list only the
       default modules.
    5) Hook function added.
    6) C/N/V supported
    7) Sandbox for modulefiles.
    8) Strong use of Spider cache file.
    9) Support for new function pushenv("name","value"). It works
       like setenv("name","value"), but when the module is unloaded
       the old value is returned.  Suppose you have both a gcc module
       and an mpich module that both set CC. Then

          $ module load   gcc;    echo $CC  # -> CC=gcc
          $ module load   mpich;  echo $CC  # -> CC=mpicc
          $ module unload mpich;  echo $CC  # -> CC=???
          $ module unload gcc;    echo $CC  # -> CC is unset

       If you use both setenv("CC","..." ) then when unloading mpich
       CC has no value.  If you use pushenv("CC","...") then CC will
       return to "gcc" after unloading mpich and have no value when
       gcc is unloaded.

Version 4.2.1:
  Features:
    1) Spider cache file changes: If a site has a system cache file
       then a user with personal module directories will use the
       system cache and only store their personal cache.
    2) This version makes multiple prepending multiple work in
       "normal" and not "reverse" order.  Previous version had
       this "reverse" be the default.
    3) There is now a "pre-install" target which does everything
       but make the link between the new version and "lmod"
  Bug Fixes:
    1) If the system changes the default module directories and
       a user has a named collection then Lmod will report that
       the system MODULEPATH has changed and it will load system
       defaults and not the users collection.

Version 4.1.4:
 Bug Fixes:
   1) When the warning is produced the Lmod Warning message is
      now colorized (just the Lmod Warning part)
   2) There is now a small change in "module restore". Previously
      if a save module changed or did not exist the whole restore
      would error.  Now Lmod reports which modules are missing and
      which modules have changed, it then loads all requested
      modules that it can find.


Version 4.1:
 Features:
   1) Save/Restore replaced getdefault/setdefault.  See module help
      for more details.  
   2) Default module chosen by version sorting.  So foo/5.10 will
      be the default even though foo/5.6 exists. See
      src/parseVersion.lua comments for complete rules.  There is
      a test code in contrib/parseVersions/pv. Below is a list
      of how version will be sorted. The left side shows a
      package version, the right side shows the internal string
      generated to sort version numbers.

   2.4dev1: 000000002.000000004.*@.000000001.*zfinal
     2.4a1: 000000002.000000004.*a.000000001.*zfinal

     3.2-2: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal-.000000002.*zfinal
    3.2-p3: 000000003.000000002.*zfinal-.000000003.*zfinal
      

 Bug Fix:
   1) Better handling of swapping out modules: default modules
      find default modules when swapped.  Non-default modules do
      not.


Version 4.0.1/4.0.2/4.0.3:
 Bug Fixes:
   1) Better savings of module cache file on fast systems.
   2) Fixed bug with csh use of "set_shell_function()"
   3) Fixed build error on Redhat based systems.
   4) Fixed SitePackage: only do things on mode() == 'load'
   5) Fixed SitePackage to be read by all Lmod tools.
   6) Lmod correctly handles a ^C when using more as PAGER.

Version 4.0:
 New Requirement:
  You will need the lua header files.  This will typically
  require the lua-devel or liblua5.1-0-dev or similar packages.

 Features:
  1) A handy front end for the module command: ml
        $ ml
                                 means: module list
        $ ml foo bar
                                 means: module load foo bar
        $ ml -foo -bar baz goo
                                 means: module unload foo bar;
                                        module load baz goo;

     It does much more, do: "ml --help" for more information.

  2) Now uses the env. var PAGER or /bin/more to page through
     "module spider" and "module avail"

  3) Lmod now supports properties:

     add_property("arch","value1")
     add_property("arch","value2")

     See .lmodrc.lua for how to setup your properties.

  4) Lmod now knows if stderr is connected to a terminal or not.
     This means that the pager (and the color output of properties)
     are bypassed and straight text is written out when the output
     is a file and not a tty.  (Thanks to pieces from lua-term:
     git://github.com/hoelzro/lua-term.git)


  5) Support for shell functions under bash or csh aliases.
     For lua module files only:

        set_shell_function("name","bash_function_str",
                                  "csh_alias_str")

     so the new ml command can be defined in a lua module file as:

        set_shell_function("ml",'eval $($LMOD_DIR/ml_cmd "$@")',
                                "eval `$LMOD_DIR/ml_cmd $*`")
                             
     (csh alias internally translate the "$*" to "\!*")

     NOTE: Subshells do NOT inherit alias or shell functions!
     This means every subshell will need to load any modules that
     define aliases or shell functions.

  6) added module functions "always_load(...)", "always_unload(...)"
     The function "always_load('abc')" could be replaced by:

        if (mode() == "load") then
           load('abc')
        end

     That is, it always loads and never unloads.

     The always_unload('abc') inside a modulefile will ALWAYS
     cause the module 'abc' to be unloaded.  This is safe to do even
     if the module is not loaded.

  7) Support for a "SitePackage" lua file to add functions to be available
     for your lua based modulefiles.  See contrib/SitePackage for an example.
     

  
Version 3.6/3.6.1:

 Features:
    1) The command:
         $ module spider foo
       is now a case-insensitive search.  This means that "foo" will
       match "foo", "Foo", "FooBar" and "BarFoo".
    2) The "mode()" function return:

         load, unload, help, whatis, spider

       depending on what mode the module file is beening read.

    3) Note that when reading in modules with the "computeHash" program
       the mode is "load".  The computeHash program is used to compute
       sha1 hashes of files as part of the setdefault/getdefault commands.


 Bug Fixes:
    1) set_alias() now correctly load and unloads, doesn't load
       during spider.
    2) module spider doesn't stop on a modulefile syntax error.
       It reports the error and keeps going.
    3) Loading a modulefile with a syntax error is handled
       cleanly.
    4) Lmod now searches all possible caches and picks the one which is newest.

Version 3.5.1/3.5.2:

   Features:

   1) Support for perl added.
   2) Support for python added:

      Example:

      #!/usr/bin/env python

      import os, sys
      sys.path.insert(0,"/opt/apps/lmod/lmod/setup/")

      from env_modules_python import module

      module("load","foobar")

      print "os.environ['FOOBAR']: ",os.environ['FOOBAR']

      module("avail");
     
   

Version 3.4.2:

   Features:

   1) A Lua modulefile can have a new command "try_load()". It is
      the same as a load() EXCEPT that it will not produce an error
      if the module does NOT exist.

   2) Similarily a TCL modulefile can have:

        module try-add foo

      which will load "foo" if it exists.  If it doesn't then there is
      no error reported.

Version 3.4.1/3.4.0

  Changes/Features:

  1) The structure of modules file directories has been extended.
     Previous versions required that symbolic links could only be used
     with files and not directories.  You can now use a symlink to
     a directory.  This is useful when trying to use Lmod with an existing
     module tree.


  2) The module list can be search:

     $ module list pattern1 pattern2 ...

     This command will report any module loaded that match pattern1
     or pattern2 ...

     $ module list gcc b

     Currently Loaded Modules Matching: gcc or b
     1) gcc/4.6.2  2) boost/1.49.0
     
  3) The configure script now checks to see that both lfs and posix are
     available or the script quits.

  4) Support for a system cache directory:

     ./configure --with-spiderCacheDir=/path/to/systemCacheDir

     On slow file system such as lustre a "module spider" can take
     a while. If one creates a cron that runs hourly to produce a 
     spider file.

     spider -o moduleT $LMOD_DEFAULT_MODULEPATH > /path/to/systemCacheDir/moduleT.lua


  Bug fixes:

  1) Previously modules name with special regular expression
     characters such as "-" would not be found with "module avail"
     and "module spider" now they will.
  
  2) There was a subtle bug with the way the module table was written
     out and read from the environment.  In rare cases, the module table
     could get corrupted.   This is now fixed.

  3) Previously, if MODULEPATH was not set then a lua error would be
     reported. This is now fixed.


Version 3.3.9

  1) This version fixes a bug in spider output.  Now if a modulefile
     could be found via two or more ways through the software hierarchy, 
     all parents will be reported.
  2) A new module command "reset" is now supported.  If the environment
     variable "LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES" contains a list of modules
     then issuing "module reset" will do a "module purge" and then load
     the list of modules specified by the this env. variable.
  3) Users can now specify directories as part of the name given to a
     "module default" name.  In other words doing
     "module setdefault foo/bar/baz" will create a file
     $HOME/.lmod.d/foo/bar/baz that has the current list of modules.
     Doing "module getdefault foo/bar/baz" will revive it.
  4) A new function "is_spider()" has been added. It return true if the
     modulefile being read by the spider command.

Version 3.3.6

  This version supports a different separator for path like variables:
  For TCL module files, it supports the "--delim" style:

    prepend-path --delim ";" LUA_PATH  "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.lua;/apps/lua/share/5.1/?;;"
    append-path  --delim ";" LUA_CPATH "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.so"

  For lua modulefiles you can give an optional third argument:

    prepend_path("LUA_PATH",  "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.lua;/a/lua/share/5.1/?;;",";")
    append_path( "LUA_CPATH", "/a/lua/share/5.1/?.so", ";")

Version 3.3.5

  This version better handles reporting the same module at multiple levels
  of the hierarchy through "module spider". If a module is a "Core" module
  as well as compiler and/or mpi/compiler dependent,
  "module spider" now reports that.


Version 3.2.1

  This version set return an error if there are any warning.  So if a user
  does:

     $ module load foo bar baz

  and "foo" and "bar" exist and "baz" does not then Lmod will load "foo"
  and "bar" and report a warning that "baz" wasn't loaded.


Version 3.1.2

  This version of Lmod supports the module command: "module spider" which
  will tell users all the modules that are possible independent of where
  the files are in the module hierarchy.  

Version 2.13

  This version of Lmod provide support for the "family" command.  The family
  command makes it easy to prevent user from loading two version of the same
  "family".  For example on our system, most users should not have two
  compilers loaded at the same time.  To support this feature, all you need
  do is add the following to all the compiler modulefiles:

  For TCL modulefiles do:

    family "compiler"

  For lua module files do:

    family("compiler")

  The word in quotes is case-sensitive so "Compiler" and "compiler" and
  "COMPILER" are all different.

  You can have different families.  So we currently have a "compiler"
  family and a "MPI" family.

  Expert users really want two of the same family loaded at the same time
  can set the environment variable "LMOD_EXPERT" to "1".  This will bypass
  the test for them.
