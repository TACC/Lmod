New Features in Lmod
====================

**Dynamic Spider Cache Support**:
     (Lmod 8.7.4+): If a modulefile changes $MODULEPATH, it is marked
     as dynamic and is re-read when performing a *module spider*.
     This is to allow sites to dynamically add in modulefiles in user
     directories.  This can be turned off at configure time or with by
     setting LMOD_DYNAMIC_SPIDER_CACHE=no.

**Warning when reading too many non-modulefile**:
     Lmod (8.7.4+): To catch directory that are full of
     non-modulefiles, Lmod count the number of regular files that do
     not start with a ".". If there are more than 100, Lmod reports
     a warning.

**Loading a modulefile too many times**:
     (Lmod 8.7.3+): Lmod throws an error if any modulefile is loaded
     500 time or more in a single module command.  This is to prevent
     infinite load loops.

**An unload cannot fail**:
     As of Lmod 8.7+, an error found during unload is treated as a
     warning.

**puts stdout**:
     This TCL modulefile will generate its output at the end of the
     modulefile evaluation and not the beginning. New in Lmod 8.7.
     This matches Tmod 4.1

**puts prestdout**:
     This TCL modulefile will generate its output at the beginning of the
     modulefile evaluation. New in Lmod 8.7. This matches Tmod 5.1.

**LmodBreak**:
     LmodBreak() modulefile function causes the evaluation of the
     current modulefile to stop and all changed in the user's
     environment to be ignored from the current modulefile.  However,
     all other modulefiles are evaluated.  In TCL modulefiles, this
     command is **break**.  Break works normally inside a loop.  If a
     bare break is found outside a loop, it cause the current
     modulefile stop its processing. New in Lmod 8.7+

     **Note** As of Lmod 8.6.16: LmodBreak()/break does nothing when
     unloading. 


**/etc/lmod/lmod_config.lua**:
     Lmod looks for a file named lmod_config.lua in the
     LMOD_CONFIG_DIR which is by default /etc/lmod/lmod_config.lua.
     This file allows sites configure lmod through lua instead
     of setting environment variables by using the cosmit:assigin()
     functions::
         
         cosmit:assign("LMOD_SITE_NAME","XYZZY")

     See :ref:`lmod_config-label` for details.  New in Lmod 8.6+

**LMOD_QUARANTINE_VARS**:

     This is an environment variable containing a list of environment
     variables that Lmod will not change the value of.  Note that this
     only applies to non-path variables.  Variables such as PATH or
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH are ignored in this variable.  In other words,
     Lmod could change any path like variables.  New in Lmod 8.6+

**source_sh** ("shellName","shell_script arg1 ..."):
     source a shell script as part of a module. Supported shellNames
     are *sh*, *dash*, *bash*, *zsh*, *csh*, *tcsh*, *ksh*.  When
     loading, Lmod automatically converts the shell script into module
     commands and saves the module commands in the environment.  It
     does this by sourcing the shell script string in a subshell and
     comparing the environment before and after sourcing the shell
     script string. When unloading, the saved module commands from the
     environment are used.

     See :ref:`sh_to_modulefile-label` for details (New in version 8.6) 
     


**sh_to_modulefile**:
   New in version 8.6, it now track converts alias and shell functions
   as well as environment variables into a modulefile.

**LMOD_SITE_MODULEPATH**:
    An colon separated list of directories to be prepended to
    $MODULEPATH before the first call to the Lmod command.
    See :ref:`lmod_site_modulepath-label` for details
    New in version 8.5.18

**module overview**:
     Similar to **module avail**, this command prints the just
     module name and not the name and the version.  The number of
     versions is printed next to the module name:  For example::

        $ module overview

        ------------ /apps/modulefiles/Core -------------
        StdEnv    (1)   hashrf    (2)   papi        (2)  
        ddt       (1)   intel     (2)   singularity (2)   
        git       (1)   noweb     (1)   valgrind    (1)

    New in version 8.5.10+

**sh_to_modulefile**:
   New in version 8.6, it now track converts alias and shell functions
   as well as environment variables into a modulefile.

**extension()**:
   New in version 8.2.5+, Lmod provides a module function which says
   that these packages available when this module is loaded.  See
   :ref:`extensions-label` for details.
      
**depends_on()**:
  A safe way to have one module load another.  See
  :ref:`dependent_modules-label` for details.  New in version 7.5.12+
