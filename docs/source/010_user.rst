User Guide for Lmod
--------------------

The guide here explains how to use modules. The User's tour of the
module command covers the basic uses of modules. The other sections
can be read at a later date as issues come up. The Advance user's
guide is for users needing to create their own modulefiles.

User's Tour of the Module Command
_________________________________

The module command sets the appropriate environment variable
independent of the user's shell.  Typically the system will load a
default set of modules.  A user can list the modules loaded by::

    $ module list

To find out what modules are available to be loaded a user can do::

    $ module avail

To load packages a user simply does::

    $ module load package1 package2 ...

To unload packages a user does::

    $ module unload package1 package2 ...

A user might wish to change from one compiler to another::

    $ module swap gcc intel

The above command is short for::

    $ module unload gcc
    $ module load intel

To remove all modules do::

    $ module purge

This will remove all modules.  Lmod will try to reload any sticky
modules.

To remove all modules including sticky modules do::

    $ module --force purge

A user may wish to go back to an initial set of modules::

    $ module reset

This will unload all currently loaded modules, including the sticky
ones, then load the list of modules specified by
LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES. There is a related command::

    $ module restore


This command will also unload all currently loaded modules, including
the sticky ones, and then load the system default unless the user has
a default collection. See :ref:`user_collections-label` for more
details. 

If there are many modules on a system, it can be difficult to see what
modules are available to load.  Lmod provides the overview command to
provide a concise listing.  For example::

    $ module overview

    ------------------ /opt/apps/modulefiles/Core -----------------
    StdEnv    (1)   hashrf    (2)   papi        (2)   xalt     (1)
    ddt       (1)   intel     (2)   singularity (2)   
    git       (1)   noweb     (1)   valgrind    (1)

    --------------- /opt/apps/lmod/lmod/modulefiles/Core ----------
    lmod (1)   settarg (1)

This shows the short name of the module (i.e. git, or singularity)
and the number in the parenthesis is the number of versions for each.
This list above shows that there is one version of git and two
versions of singularity.




If a module is not available then an error message is produced::

    $ module load packageXYZ
    Warning: Failed to load: packageXYZ

It is possible to try to load a module with no error message if it
does not exist. Any other failures to load will be reported.::

    $ module try-load packageXYZ

Modulefiles can contain help messages.  To access a modulefile's help
do::

    $ module help packageName

To get a list of all the commands that module knows about do::

    $ module help

The module avail command has search capabilities::

    $ module avail cc

will list for any modulefile where the name contains the string "cc".


Users may wish to test whether certain modules are already loaded::

    $ module is-loaded packageName1 packageName2 ...

Lmod will return a true status if all modules are loaded and a false
status if one is not.  Note that Lmod is setting the status bit, there is
nothing printed out. This means that one can do the following::

    $ if module is-loaded pkg ; then echo "pkg is loaded"; fi

Users also may wish to test whether certain modules can be loaded with
the current $MODULEPATH::

    $ module is-avail packageName1 packageName2 ...

Lmod will a true status if all modules are available and false if one
can not be loaded. Again this command sets the status bit.

Modulefiles can have a description section known as "whatis".  It is
accessed by::

    $ module whatis pmetis
    pmetis/3.1	: Name: ParMETIS
    pmetis/3.1	: Version: 3.1
    pmetis/3.1	: Category: library, mathematics
    pmetis/3.1	: Description: Parallel graph partitioning..

There is a keyword search tool: ::

    $ module keyword word1 word2 ...

This will search any help message  or whatis description for the
word(s) given on the command line.

Another way to search for modules is with the "module spider" command.
This command searches the entire list of possible modules.  The
difference between "module avail" and "module spider" is explained in
the "Module Hierarchy" and "Searching for Modules" section.::

    $ module spider

Users can also find which categories a site provides::

    $ module category

    ------------------ List of Categories --------------------
    Compiler           Programming tools        library      
    Graph partitioner  System Environment/Base  mpi
    MPI library        Visual Tool              tools
    
To know which modules, users can pick one or more name from the list
of categories with the number of modules provide::

    $ module category library

    ---------------------- MPI library -----------------------
    mpich (30)   openmpi (6)

    ----------------------- library --------------------------
    boost     (1)   hdf5  (18)   pdtoolkit (1)    pmetis (6)
    fftw2     (6)   metis (2)    petsc     (13)   tau    (3)
    gotoblas2 (1)   papi  (1)    phdf5     (40)
  
Here we see that there are 30 versions of mpich and 6 version of
openmpi.  Also that category name given, in this case "library" does
partial matches and is case-insensitive.

Specifying modules to load
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modules are a way to ask for a certain version of a package.  For
example a site might have two or more versions of the gcc compiler
collection (say versions 7.1 and 8.2).  So a user may load::

    $ module load gcc

or::

    $ module load gcc/7.1

In the second case, Lmod will load gcc version 7.1 where as in the
first case Lmod will load the default version of gcc which normally be
8.2 unless the site marks 7.1 as the default.

In this user guide, we call **gcc/7.1** the **fullName** of the module
and **gcc** as the **shortName**.  We also call what the user asked
for as the **userName** which could either be the **fullName** or the
**shortName** depending on what the user typed on the command line.

Showing the contents of a module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several ways to use the show sub-command to show the
contents of a modulefile.  The first is to show the module functions
instead of executing them::

    $ module show gcc

This shows the functions such as **setenv** () or **prepend_path** ()
but nothing else.  If you want to know the contents of the modulefile
you can use::

    $ module --raw show gcc

This will show the raw text of the modulefile. This is same as
printing the modulefile, but here Lmod will find the modulefile for
you. If you want to know just the location of a modulefile do::

    $ module --redirect --location show gcc

You will probably use the --redirect option so that the output goes to
stdout and not stderr.

If you want to know how Lmod will parse a TCL modulefile you can do::

    $ tclsh $LMOD_DIR/tcl2lua.tcl  <path_to_TCL_modulefile>

This useful when there is some question on how Lmod will treat a TCL
modulefile.

ml: A convenient tool
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For those of you who can't type the *mdoule*, *moduel*, err *module*
command correctly, Lmod has a tool for you.  With **ml** you won't
have to type the module command again.  The two most common commands
are *module list* and *module load <something>* and **ml** does both::

    $ ml

means *module list*. And::

    $ ml foo

means *module load foo* while::

    $ ml -bar

means *module unload bar*.  It won't come as a surprise that you can
combine them::

    $ ml foo -bar

means *module unload bar; module load foo*.  You can do all the module
commands::

    $ ml spider
    $ ml avail
    $ ml show foo

If you ever have to load a module name *spider* you can do::

    $ ml load spider

If you are ever forced to type the **module** command instead of **ml**
then that is a bug and should be reported.


clearLmod: Complete remove Lmod setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It is rare, but sometimes a user might need to remove the Lmod setup
from their current shell.  This command can be used with
bash/zsh/csh/tcsh to remove the Lmod setup::

    $ clearLmod

This command prints a message telling the user what it has done.  This
message can be silented with::

    $ clearLmod --quiet
  
SAFETY FEATURES
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(1): Users can only have one version active: The One Name Rule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a user does: ::

    $ module avail xyz

    --------------- /opt/apps/modulefiles ----------------
    xyz/8.1   xyz/11.1 (D)   xyz/12.1

    $ module load xyz
    $ module load xyz/12.0

The first load command will load the 11.1 version of xyz. In the
second load, the module command knows that the user already has
xyz/11.1 loaded so it unloads that and then loads xyz/12.0. This
protection is only available with Lmod.

This is known as the *One Name* rule.  This feature is core to how
Lmod works and there is no way to override this.


(2) : Users can only load one compiler or MPI stack at a time.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lmod provides an additional level of protection.  If each of the
compiler modulefiles add a line: ::

    family("compiler")

Then Lmod will not load another compiler modulefile.   Another benefit
of the modulefile family directive is that an environment variable
"LMOD_FAMILY_COMPILER" is assigned the name (and not the
version). This can be useful specifying different options for
different compilers. In the High Performance Computing (HPC) world,
the message passing interface (MPI) libraries are important.  The mpi
modulefiles can contain a family("MPI") directive which will prevent
users from loading more than one MPI implementation at a time.  Also
the environment variable "LMOD_FAMILY_MPI" is defined to the name of
the mpi library.

Module Hierarchy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Libraries built with one compiler need to be linked with applications
with the same compiler version. If sites are going to provide
libraries, then there will be more than one version of the library,
one for each compiler version. Therefore, whether it is the Boost library or
an mpi library, there are multiple versions.

There are two main choices for system administrators. For the XYZ
library compiled with either the UCC compiler or the GCC compiler,
there could be the xyz-ucc modulefile and the xyz-gcc module
file. This gets much more complicated when there are multiple versions
of the XYZ library and different compilers. How does one label the
various versions of the library and the compiler? Even if one makes
sense of the version labeling, when a user changes compilers, the user
will have to remember to unload the ucc and the xyz-ucc modulefiles
when changing to gcc and xyz-gcc. If users have mismatched modules,
their programs are going to fail in very mysterious ways.

A much saner strategy is to use a module hierarchy. Each compiler module
adds to the MODULEPATH a compiler version modulefile directory. Only
modulefiles that exist in that directory are packages that have been
built with that compiler. When a user loads a particular compiler,
that user only sees modulefile(s) that are valid for that compiler.

Similarly, applications that use libraries depending on MPI
implementations must be built with the same compiler - MPI
pairing. This leads to modulefile hierarchy. Therefore, as users start with
the minimum set of loaded modules, all they will see are compilers,
not any of the packages that depend on a compiler. Once they load a
compiler they will see the modules that depend on that compiler. After
choosing an MPI implementation, the modules that depend on that
compiler-MPI pairing will be available. One of the nice features of
Lmod is that it handles the hierarchy easily. If a user swaps
compilers, then Lmod automatically unloads any modules that depends on
the old compiler and reloads those modules that are dependent on the
new compiler. ::

    $ module list

    1) gcc/4.4.5 2) boost/1.45.0

    $ module swap gcc ucc

    Due to MODULEPATH changes the follow modules have been reloaded: 1) boost

If a modulefile is not available with the new compiler, then the
module is marked as inactive. Every time MODULEPATH changes, Lmod
attempts to reload any inactive modules.

Searching For Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a user enters: ::

    $ module avail

Lmod reports only the modules that are in the current
MODULEPATH. Those are the only modules that the user can load. If
there is a modulefile hierarchy, then a package the user wants may be
available but not with the current compiler version. Lmod offers a new
command:  ::

    $ module spider

which lists all possible modules and not just the modules that can be
seen in the current MODULEPATH. This command has three modes. The
first mode is:  ::

    $ module spider

    lmod: lmod/lmod
    Lmod: An Environment Module System

    ucc: ucc/11.1, ucc/12.0, ...
    Ucc: the ultimate compiler collection

    xyz: xyz/0.19, xyz/0.20, xyz/0.31
    xyz: Solves any x or y or z problem.

This is a compact listing of all the possible modules on the
system. The second mode describes a particular module:  ::

    $ module spider ucc
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ucc:
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Description:
    Ucc: the ultimate compiler collection

    Versions:
    ucc/11.1
    ucc/12.0

The third mode reports on a particular module version and where it can
be found: ::

    $ module spider parmetis/3.1.1
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    parmetis: parmetis/3.1.1
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Description:
    Parallel graph partitioning and fill-reduction matrix ordering routines

    This module can be loaded through the following modules:
    ucc/12.0, openmpi/1.4.3
    ucc/11.1, openmpi/1.4.3
    gcc/4.4.5, openmpi/1.4.3

    Help:
    The parmetis module defines the following environment variables: ...
    The module parmetis/3.1.1 has been compiled by three different versions of the ucc compiler and one MPI implementation.

Controlling Modules During Login
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Normally when a user logs in, there are a standard set of modules that
are automatically loaded. Users can override and add to this standard
set in two ways. The first is adding module commands to their personal
startup files. The second way is through the "module save"
command.

To add module commands to users' startup scripts requires a few
steps. Bash users can put the module commands in either their
``~/.profile`` file or their ``~/.bashrc`` file. It is simplest to place the
following in their ``~/.profile`` file: ::

    if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
       .   ~/.bashrc
    fi

and place the following in their ``~/.bashrc`` file: ::

    if [ -z "$BASHRC_READ" ]; then
       export BASHRC_READ=1
       # Place any module commands here
       # module load git
    fi

By wrapping the module command in an if test, the module commands need
only be read in once. Any sub-shell will inherit the PATH and other
environment variables automatically. On login shells the ``~/.profile``
file is read which, in the above setup, causes the ``~/.bashrc`` file to
be read. On interactive non-login shells, the ``~/.bashrc`` file is read
instead. Obviously, having this setup means that module commands need
only be added in one file and not two.

Csh users need only specify the module commands in their ``~/.cshrc`` file
as that file is always sourced:  ::

    if ( ! $?CSHRC_READ ) then
       setenv CSHRC_READ 1
       # Place any module command here
       # module load git
    endif


.. _user_collections-label:

User Collections
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

User defined initial list of login modules:

Assuming that the system administrators have installed Lmod correctly,
there is a second way which is much easier to set up. A user logs in
with the standard modules loaded. Then the user modifies the default
setup through the standard module commands::

    $ module unload XYZ
    $ module swap gcc ucc
    $ module load git

Once users have the desired modules load then they issue::

    $ module save

This creates a file called ``~/.config/lmod/default`` which has the
list of desired modules. Note only the current set of modules is
recorded the in the collection. If module X loads module A and the
user deletes module A before doing ``module save collectionName`` then
module A will NOT be loaded when the collection is restored.  All
load(), always_load(), depends_on() statements inside the modulefiles
are ignored when restoring a collection. Instead Lmod loads just the
list of modulefiles stored in the collection.

Once this is set-up a user can issue::

    $ module restore

and only the desired modules will be loaded. If Lmod is setup
correctly (see :ref:`startup_w_stdenv-label`) then the default
collection will be the user's initial set of modules.

If a user doesn't have a default collection, the Lmod purges ALL
currently loaded modules, including the sticky ones, and loads the
list of module specified by LMOD_SYSTEM_DEFAULT_MODULES just like the
``module reset`` command. 

Users can have as many collections as they like.  They can save to a
named collection with::

    $ module save <collection_name>

and restore that named collection with::

    $ module restore <collection_name>

A user can print the contents of a collection with::

    $ module describe <collection_name>

A user can list the collections they have with::

    $ module savelist

Finally a user can disable a collection with::

    $ module disable <collection_name>

If no ``collection_name`` is given then the default is disabled.  Note
that the collection is not remove just renamed.  If a user disables
the foo collection, the file foo is renamed to foo~.  To restore the
foo collection, a user will have to do the following::

    $ cd ~/.config/lmod;  mv foo~ foo

Rules for loading modules from a collection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lmod has rules on what modules to load when restoring a
collection. Remember that **userName** is what the user asked for, the
**fullName** is the exact module name and **shortName** is name of the
package (e.g.  gcc, fftw3).

#. Lmod records the fullName and the userName in the collection.
#. If the userName is the same as the fullName then it loads fullName
   independent of the default.
#. if the userName is not the same as the fullName then it loads the
   default.
#. Unless LMOD_PIN_VERSIONS=yes then the fullName is always loaded.

In other words if a user does::

    $ module --force purge; module load A B C
    $ module save

then "**module restore**" will load the default A, B, and C. So if the
default for module A changed between when the collection was saved and
then restored, a new version of A will be loaded. This assumes
that LMOD_PIN_VERSIONS is not set. If it is set or Lmod is configured
that way then if A/1.1, B/2.4 and C/3.3 are the default then those
modules will be loaded in the future independent of what the defaults
are in the future.

On the other hand::

    $ module --force purge; module load A/1.0 B/2.3 C/3.4
    $ module save

then "**module restore**" will load the A/1.0, B/2.3, and C/3.4
independent of what the defaults are now or in the future.


User Collections on shared home file systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your site has a shared home file system, then things become a
little more complicated.  A shared home file system means that your
site has a single home file system shared between two or more
clusters.  See :ref:`shared_home_file_system` for a system
administrators point of view.

If you have a collection on one cluster it needs to be independent of
another cluster.  Your site should set $LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME uniquely for
each cluster.  Suppose you have cluster A and B.  Then
$LMOD_SYSTEM_NAME will be either A or B.  A default collection will
be named "default.A" for the A cluster and "default.B" for the B
cluster.  The names a user sees will have the extension removed.  In
other words on the A cluster a user would see::

    $ module savelist

      1) default

where the default file is named "default.A".

Showing hidden modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sites modules (or user personal modules) can be hidden from normal "module
avail" or "module spider" through different mechanisms. See
:ref:`hidden_modules-label`

 To see hidden modules, one can do::

    $ module --show_hidden avail
    $ module --show_hidden spider
